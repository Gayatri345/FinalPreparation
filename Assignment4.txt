Assignment 4, due Thursday March 11, at noon.

Write a Prolog program that generates all the permutations of an ordered set that do not have their largest element before their smallest one. For instance, if the set is [1,2,3,4,5] a good permutation is [4,1,3,2,5] because 1 is before 5 in it and a bad one is [4,5,3,1,2] because 1 is after 5 in it.

Test your program on the set [1,2,3,4,5] and paste the resulting permutations, one per line, inside a /* ... */ comment at the end of your .pro code file.

Submit your .pro file on Canvas, one file per team.
