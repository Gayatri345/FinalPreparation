Team assignment 2, due Thursday 25 February at 10 am.

Solve the following 2 problems and submit your assignment on canvas, one assignment per team, with the team members names also marked on it. Please add the output of your code as a Haskell comment at the end of your .hs file.

Problem 1.

A Haskell program has the following definitions

worm  = 1:2:3:worm
eel   = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]
snake = 3:2:1:snake
bird  = 1:2:bird
whale = [1..100]

Add a function "which" (defined from a list of integers to strings) that works as follows

*Main> which worm
"worm"
*Main> which eel
"eel"
*Main> which snake
"snake"
*Main> which whale
"whale"
*Main> which bird
"bird"

More precisely, you will need to write a function that recognizes which of the 5 lists is given to it as input and then it returns its name, as a string. You do not need to worry what the function would return if a list, other than worm, eel, snake, bird or whale is given to it.

Problem 2.

Question 2. A rose tree with roses of type "a" is defined in Haskell as

data RT a = Rose a | Tree [RT a] deriving (Show,Read,Eq)

Roses on a tree can be either red or white, represented with an appropriate data type that you will need to specify.

You are a gardener in "Alice in Wonderland", fearing the Queen that might chop off your head if your roses are not all red (like shown in this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfmAzoILaK8 ).

In panic mode, you must write a Haskell program that paints red all the roses on a rose tree. 

Test your program on 5 trees, each holding at least 5 roses.
