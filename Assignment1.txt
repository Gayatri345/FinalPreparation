The following Python program generates Motzkin trees (binary-unary trees). They are made of leaves, unary nodes (nodes with one branch) and binary nodes (nodes with two branches).

# Motzkin tree of size n
def mot (n) :
  if n==0 : 
    yield 'leaf'
  else :
    for m in mot(n-1) :
      yield ('unary',m)
    for k in range(0,n-1) :    
      for l in mot(k) :
        for r in mot(n-2-k) :        
          yield ('binary',l,r)

def test(m) :
  for n in range(m) :
    list(map(print,list(mot(n)))) 
    
Write a similar Python program that generates trees having nodes with 1, 2 or 3 branches.

To facilitate grading, the program should provide a function similar to "test(m)", that, given a natural number m, prints out all trees of size less than m, one per line, in the same format.
