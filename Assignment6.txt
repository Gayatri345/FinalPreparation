Write a set of Python classes, connected by inheritance, that classify quadrilaterals, as shown in the picture at:

http://www.cse.unt.edu/~tarau/teaching/GPL/HomeWorks/quad.pdf


1) For each of the quadrilaterals, a method 

  parents() 

should be implemented that returns the name(s) of its parent(s).


2) For each of the quadrilaterals, a method 

  ancestors() 

should be implemented that returns the name(s) of all its parent(s) or ancestors of its parent(s)


3) By using your favorite drawing program, define a method 

  show() 

that draws the quadrilateral defined by its constructor method.

4) Attach a complete set of tests showing an instance creation for each of the classes as well as a picture created by your show() method as a PDF, PNG, GIF or JPG file.
